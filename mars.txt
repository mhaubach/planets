landed on Mars and looking around
This is the second time  in mars
we are embarking on a new journey
to grandmother's house - over hill and over dale

Cold and Dry, but everything is my favorite color, gray
the two moons may be a problem for wolfman
but the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
all ill-considered change
